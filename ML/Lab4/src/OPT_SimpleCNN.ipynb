    "## Model as it is:\n",
    "In the first configuration, the training and validation accuracy showed a brief period of improvement but deteriorated significantly after a few epochs, highlighting instability in the training process. The loss metrics exhibited exponential growth, indicating divergence and poor convergence during optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Witht SGD optimizaer and lr = 0.0001\n",
    "To address the instability, we replaced the optimizer with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and reduced the learning rate to 0.0001. However, these modifications yielded minimal improvement. The training process remained unstable, with the accuracy curves for both training and validation datasets mirroring the behavior observed in the initial model, failing to converge to a stable state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## With vs without data augmentation\n",
    "We employed data augmentation and L2 regularization as strategies to stabilize the training process. This approach resulted in a steady increase in both training and validation accuracy up to epoch 15. However, beyond this point, the training process collapsed, indicating instability. Notably, validation accuracy consistently exceeded training accuracy throughout, suggesting potential underfitting, likely due to overly aggressive regularization limiting the model’s capacity to learn from the training data effectively."
